# Copy and paste these three commands into
# the terminal on the RPi to open the Python IDLE
# I made a "virtual environment" in which to run
# OpenCV. OpenCV is not accessible to Python
# outside of the virtual environment, so you
# have to open the Pythyon IDLE from inside the 
# virtual envorionment to be able to use it.
# That's what these three commands do.

# From there, go to file->open to open your script
# using OpenCV.
